## Glossary

**Pension Pot** is the total amount of money that an individual has saved or accumulated for their retirement. It comprises regular contributions made by the individual, contributions from their employer (if applicable), and any investment growth or interest earned over time.

**Desired Pension Pot** is the total amount the user needs at the point of retirement to sustain their desired annual income throughout retirement.

**Projected Pension Pot** is the estimated amount of money that the user is expected to have accumulated by the time they reach their chosen retirement age.

**Retirement balance** is the projected amount of money available in the user's pension pot at various stages of their retirement. It reflects how the pension pot changes over time as the user withdraws their desired annual income and potentially continues to earn interest. The retirement balance helps visualize how long the pension pot will last and whether it will be sufficient to meet the user's income needs throughout retirement.
